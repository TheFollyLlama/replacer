Simple API text replacer

CI Stack:
 github-action
 terraform
 heroku
 ruby/sinatra

Currently running on heroku:
  curl replacement-butter.herokuapp.com
  browser: replacement-butter.herokuapp.com/replace/Google mostly harmless Amazon chicken nuggets Deloitte and stuff and things
  curl -X POST -d '{"input":"Google chicken nuggets Amazon mostly harmless Deloitte and stuff and things"}' replacement-butter.herokuapp.com/replace

I took this as an opportunity to learn github-actions, and heroku.
